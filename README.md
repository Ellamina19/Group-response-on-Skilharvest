## Group-response-on-Skilharvest
This clearly shows the response gotten from skilharvest students. Let's dive into details shall we?ðŸ•º

## Project Overview

This project emphasize on the information of skilharvest student, with their permission to visualize their data inorder to derive an insight about skiharvest students.

## Data Sources

The data source was gotten from the google form that was dropped by my facilitator sir Teedee inorder to collect data from them

## Tools Used
- Google form mainly for collecting data
  
- Microsoft Excel for fetching dataset and previewing it
  
- Power Bi for data cleaning and visualization

  ## Exploratory Data Analysis

  From the above data set, we want to know the number of response gotten from students through the google form and to analyze carefully on the datasets

  ## Data cleaning
  
  I did some data cleaning by replacing a null value on the country residence, and also changing the data type

  ## Findings
  ![data](https://github.com/Ellamina19/Group-response-on-Skilharvest/blob/main/SKILHARVEST%20FORM%20RESPONSE%202.jpg)

  From the image above, we can deduce the following;
  - The total email response gotten from the students is 44
  - The male has more count than the female, inorder words the male are of large numbers
  - In terms of level of education, HND/BSC/B.Tech has the highest value of students taking the scholarship on data analysis, the lowest is SSCE
  - People from the age range of 25-29 have the highest population in skillharvest
  - When it comes to marital status, the single has the highest populations
  - Lastly, when iot comes to occupation, students were the highest
 
  ## Conclusion
  The essence of this visualization is to acquaint us on hyow to use google form to collect data and import it to our power Bi for visualization.
  I sincerely thank my facilitator Sir Teedee for enlighten me on this google form and it wonders.
